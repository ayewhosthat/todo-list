### Overview
This was by far the most challenging project yet, for a multitude of reasons. Not only did I have to be mindful of the proper Object Oriented Programming principles and dividing my code into chunks, but I also needed to incorporate tabbed browsing in order to switch between projects, and this proved to be more challenging than expected (more down below).

# Difficulties
The main struggle when doing this project was tabbed browsing. My approach was to give each project 'button' an id corresponding to the acutal project name, minus any non HTML characters (this was done using .replace()/.replaceAll() along with some regex metacharacters)

# Next steps for improvement
- Very minimalistic, lacks substantial styling to make it appealing. As with most of these projects, the focus was function first and foremost, and the minimum amount of styling to make it look at the very least non-unappealing
- Perhaps add a feature to delete projects/mark them as completed, instead of giving this functionality only to the item cards
